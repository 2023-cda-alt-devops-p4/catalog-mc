## Context

For our first assignment for the CDA training with Simplon, we need to build a website that showcases all the UML and Merise diagrams.
We must highlight the most important diagrams, making sure the website is responsive.


### Structure

You must create your "catalog" with:

✔️ A homepage  
✔️ UML diagrams

✔️ the main navigation  
​

✔️ Highlight the "essential diagrams."  

### Design

You should:

❌ Adopting the Mobile First concept  
❌ Use media queries for tablet and PC versions  
✔️ Add animations, pop-ups, etc., using CSS/JavaScript  
❌ Deploy it on a push deployment service like GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel  
​

### Deliverables

✔️  A ZIP archive of your project  
✔️  A link to a GitHub repository 
❌  A link to your new online catalog  

### Performance Criteria

✔️  The project must be regularly versioned atomically  
❌  The website must comply with W3C standards  
❌  The website has no dead links   
❌  The website is adaptable
